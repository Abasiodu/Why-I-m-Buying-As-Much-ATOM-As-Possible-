# Summary of Cosmos vs Ethereum Killers Video 🎥

## Ethereum Killers' Struggles
- Avalanche, Solana, and Cardano have underperformed compared to Ethereum in recent bear markets. 🚫

## Why Cosmos Stands Out
1. **Unique Design:**
   - Cosmos operates as a "layer zero" blockchain, connecting various standalone blockchains through its central hub. 🌐
   - Features the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol for seamless cross-chain communication. 🔗
   - Utilizes the Cosmos SDK for streamlined development and the Tendermint consensus engine for efficient scaling. ⚙️

2. **Rise of App Chains:**
   - App chains are blockchains tailored for specific applications, offering optimization and dedicated resources. 💡
   - Examples include dYdX migrating from Ethereum to Cosmos for improved functionality and user experience. 🔄

3. **Increased Liquidity:**
   - Introduction of liquid staking and new app chains like Tenet, which supports restaking of out-of-ecosystem tokens. 💧
   - Launch of new stablecoins, including algorithmic and fiat-backed options, enhancing liquidity across the Cosmos ecosystem. 💵

4. **Tokenomics Upgrade:**
   - Cosmos is working on a significant tokenomics upgrade to enhance the value of the Atom token. 🔼
   - Includes plans like reducing token inflation and introducing a new security model for app chains. 🔒

## Final Thoughts
- Cosmos is gaining traction due to its innovative approach and upcoming upgrades. 📈
- The speaker also has positive views on Solana and Polygon. 🌟
